Be a happy man from tomorrow on

Feed horses, chop wood, travel the world

From tomorrow on, care about food and vegetables

I have a house facing the sea, with spring flowers blooming

From tomorrow on, communicate with every relative

Tell them my happiness

That happy lightning told me

I will tell everyone

Give every river and every mountain a warm name

Strangers, I also bless you

Wish you a bright future

May your lover finally get married

Wish you happiness in this world

I just want to face the sea and the spring flowers bloom
